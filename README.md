## machine learning model

it's a simple indicator based on a 3 second delay.
the data is captured seeing which memecoins increase after 3 seconds.
that's what the model is trained on.

NOTE: DO NOT USE INCLUDED MODEL, NOT TRAINED ON ENOUGH DATA

## mathematical models

Mainly the trading was going to be based on fibonacci trading on higher market cap coins.
If you'd like to do that you can, all fibonacci functions are already implemented.
